# [1-4] Implement secure token storage and admin API

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Store Railway API tokens securely (encrypted at rest) and expose an admin endpoint or CLI to set/update tokens without exposing them in logs. Note: For MVP, this is deferred; we will use an environment variable for the Railway API token and revisit secure storage in a later PBI.
