## Requirements
- Encrypted storage of tokens.
- Admin-only endpoint/CLI with auth guard.
- Tokens never returned in plain text.

## Implementation Plan
- Choose encryption approach and key management.
- Implement storage and retrieval abstractions.
- Add admin endpoint/CLI with audit logging.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for encryption/decryption.
- Manual verification that plaintext is never logged.

## Verification
- Set token via admin flow; backend uses token successfully.

## Files Modified
- Backend security, storage, and admin handler files.
