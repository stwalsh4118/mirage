# [1-7] Initialize frontend (Next.js) and base layout

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Create a Next.js application (routing/UI only) with base layout, routing, and shared UI primitives to host the dashboard and wizard. Do not use Next.js API routes; all APIs are served by the Go Gin backend.

## Files Modified
