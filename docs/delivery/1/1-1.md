| 2025-09-05 12:31:00 | Status Change | Agreed | InProgress | Started scaffolding Gin API service | ai-agent |
| 2025-09-05 12:55:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Gin server scaffolding, zerolog, health endpoint, and config placeholders completed | ai-agent |

## Requirements
- Go module initialized with standard layout.
- Gin HTTP server with health endpoint.
- Configuration loader for DB and Railway credentials (placeholders).
- Structured logging setup.

## Implementation Plan
- Scaffold directories and main entry with Gin router.
- Add health route and middleware.
- Implement config loading (env vars, config file optional).
- Add logging and error handling middleware.

## Test Plan
- Service builds and runs locally.
- Health endpoint returns 200.
- Config loads with defaults and overrides.

## Verification
- Manual run confirms health and logs.
- Linting passes; module compiles.

## Files Modified
- To be created in backend service directory.
