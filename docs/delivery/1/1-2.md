## Requirements
- Configurable Railway API endpoint and token.
- Functions: createEnvironment, destroyEnvironment.
- Retry with exponential backoff on retryable errors.

## Implementation Plan
- Define client interface and types.
- Implement GraphQL request wrapper with error handling.
- Implement create/destroy functions.
- Unit tests for retry behavior (mocked responses).

## Test Plan
- Unit tests: retry logic, error classification, success path.
- Integration smoke test against a mock or sandbox.

## Verification
- Demo call creates and destroys a stub env (sandbox/mocked).

## Files Modified
- Backend client package files.
