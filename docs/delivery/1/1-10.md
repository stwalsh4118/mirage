[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Wire frontend and backend end-to-end for environment lifecycle and implement near-real-time status updates using 5s polling for MVP.

## Requirements
- Frontend calls backend create/destroy/status APIs.
- Backend updates DB and returns current status.
- Client polling updates dashboard cards in ~5s.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement status endpoint in backend.
- Add polling hooks and state management in UI.
- Verify update cadence and UI consistency.

## Test Plan
- Manual E2E create/destroy with status propagation.
- Latency measurement under 5s average.

## Verification
- Demo from empty to created to destroyed with UI reflecting changes.

## Files Modified
- Frontend hooks/components and backend status handlers.
