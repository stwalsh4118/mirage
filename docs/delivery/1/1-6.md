# [1-6] Implement status reconciliation polling

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Add a background job to poll Railway for environment/service status and reconcile state in the database, emitting updates for the UI.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|

## Requirements
- Periodic polling with configurable interval.
- Reconciliation logic for statuses and errors.
- Event emission to WebSocket channel (placeholder for MVP).

## Implementation Plan
- Scheduler for periodic jobs.
- Railway status fetcher and diff logic.
- Update DB and publish changes.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for reconciliation logic on sample inputs.
- Manual observation of status changes in logs/UI.

## Verification
- Status changes propagate to UI within target latency.

## Files Modified
- Backend jobs and status modules.
- `api/internal/config/config.go`
- `api/internal/railway/env.go`
- `api/internal/jobs/status_poller.go`
- `api/cmd/server/main.go`
