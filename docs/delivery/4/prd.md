# PBI-4: Railway GraphQL API Abstraction Layer

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-4)

## Overview
Develop a higher-level abstraction over Railway's GraphQL API to simplify environment and service lifecycle operations, including batching, retries, and status webhooks.

## Problem Statement
Direct use of Railway's GQL API for multi-service operations is verbose and error-prone. Reliable deployments require batching and robust error handling.

## User Stories
- As a backend engineer, I can perform multi-service deployments via a single high-level call.
- As a platform engineer, I get retry/backoff on transient failures.
- As a user, I see accurate deployment status via webhooks/polling.

## Technical Approach
- Client library encapsulating GraphQL queries/mutations.
- Batch operations with idempotency tokens.
- Error classification and exponential backoff with jitter.
- Webhook listener for deployment and service status; polling fallback.

## UX/UI Considerations
- Surface clear error messages and suggested actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- High-level functions cover create/update/destroy environment/service.
- Batching reduces API round trips for multi-service deploys.
- Retries on transient errors with backoff; no duplicate side effects.
- Webhook events update environment/service status reliably.

## Dependencies
- Railway GraphQL credentials and webhook endpoint.

## Open Questions
- Idempotency strategy for create/update operations.
- Rate limiting handling and backpressure.

## Related Tasks
- PBI-6 Real-time status depends on webhook/polling signals.
