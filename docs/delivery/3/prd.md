# PBI-3: Configuration Management Layer

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-3)

## Overview
Provide a configuration system with inheritance and overrides for environments and services, integrating secret management and previewing effective configuration before deployment.

## Problem Statement
Inconsistent configuration across environments leads to drift and failures. Teams need structured inheritance with clear overrides and secure secret handling.

## User Stories
- As a platform engineer, I can define base configs per environment type.
- As a developer, I can override variables for a specific environment instance.
- As a user, I can preview the final effective configuration before deploy.

## Technical Approach
- Inheritance chain: base → environment-type → instance.
- Secret management integration (provider-agnostic interface; start with Railway variables).
- Service-level overrides applied after environment scope.
- Validation and diffing utilities for configuration drift detection.

## UX/UI Considerations
- Editor UI with inheritance preview and override indicators.
- Validation errors highlighted inline.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Inheritance resolution produces deterministic effective config.
- Supports secure storage of secrets; sensitive values not exposed.
- Service-level overrides applied and previewed correctly.

## Dependencies
- Secret storage (initially Railway). Optional future KMS.

## Open Questions
- Import/export of configuration sets.
- Policy for masking vs redacting secrets in UI and logs.

## Related Tasks
- PBI-1 MVP uses simple templates; this layer generalizes templates.
