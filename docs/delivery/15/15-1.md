# [15-1] Research Railway API for environment variables and create reference guide

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and document Railway's GraphQL API for environment variables. This includes how to fetch all environment variables for a given environment, and how to set/update environment variables. Create a comprehensive reference guide similar to the existing Railway API guides in the docs/delivery folder.

## Requirements

1. **Research Railway GraphQL Schema**:
   - Identify query for fetching environment variables
   - Identify mutation for upserting environment variables
   - Document variable structure (key, value, metadata)
   - Understand authentication and authorization model
   - Document any pagination or filtering capabilities

2. **Document Query Structure**:
   - Query name and input parameters
   - Response structure and fields
   - Example query with variables
   - Error handling patterns

3. **Document Mutation Structure**:
   - Mutation name and input parameters
   - Support for batch updates vs individual updates
   - Response structure
   - Example mutation with variables
   - Idempotency considerations

4. **Environment Variable Structure**:
   - Key/value format
   - Metadata fields (e.g., isSecret, description)
   - Service-specific vs environment-wide variables
   - System variables vs user variables

5. **Create Reference Guide**:
   - Location: `docs/delivery/15/15-1-railway-variables-guide.md`
   - Follow existing guide format from PBI 12 and PBI 11
   - Include date stamp and task reference
   - Link to official Railway documentation
   - Provide Go implementation examples

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Review Railway official documentation for environment variables
   - Use web search to find Railway GraphQL API documentation
   - Look at existing Railway client code for patterns
   - Test queries/mutations in Railway's GraphQL playground if available

2. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Create guide document with standard structure:
     - Overview
     - Source Documentation links
     - Fetching Variables section with examples
     - Setting Variables section with examples
     - Go Implementation Patterns
     - Error Handling
   - Include complete GraphQL query/mutation examples
   - Provide Go code snippets for implementation

3. **Validation**:
   - Verify examples are accurate and complete
   - Ensure guide follows existing guide patterns
   - Test queries against Railway API if possible

## Test Plan

### Success Criteria

Given the research and documentation nature of this task, success is measured by:

1. **Completeness**: Guide documents all necessary API operations for environment variables
2. **Accuracy**: Information is verified against official Railway documentation
3. **Usability**: Examples are clear and can be directly used in implementation
4. **Consistency**: Guide follows same format as existing Railway guides

### Validation Steps

1. Guide includes GraphQL query for fetching variables
2. Guide includes GraphQL mutation for setting variables
3. Examples include proper variable structures
4. Go implementation patterns are provided
5. Error handling is documented
6. Links to official documentation are included
7. Date stamp and task reference present

## Verification

- [x] Railway API documentation reviewed

- [x] Variable structure and fields documented
- [x] Go implementation examples provided
- [x] Error handling patterns documented
- [x] Reference guide created at correct location
- [x] Guide follows existing format patterns
- [x] All examples tested or verified against official docs

## Files Modified
