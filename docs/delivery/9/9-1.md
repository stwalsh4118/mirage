## Requirements
- Fetch projects (details) and display as cards with counts.
- Link each card to `/dashboard/projects/[id]`.
- Polling ~30s; manual refresh.

## Implementation Plan
- Hook: reuse `useRailwayProjectsDetails()`.
- Component: `ProjectsGrid` and `ProjectCard`.
- Wire into `/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`.

## Test Plan
- Manually verify list loads and links work.

## Verification
- Visible projects with accurate counts; navigation to details page works.
- KPI strip reflects projects/services/plugins/environments totals.
- Controls filter/search/sort are applied to projects grid.

## Files Modified
- Frontend dashboard components and page.
