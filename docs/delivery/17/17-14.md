# [17-14] Refactor Railway client to support per-user tokens

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Refactor the Railway client initialization to support per-user tokens fetched from Vault. Add a factory function to create user-specific Railway clients dynamically based on user ID and Vault integration.

## Requirements

1. Keep existing `NewClient()` function for backward compatibility
2. Add `GetUserRailwayClient()` factory function
3. Fetch Railway token from Vault based on user ID
4. Create and return Railway client with user's token
5. Handle missing tokens gracefully with clear errors
6. Support fallback to env var token when Vault disabled
7. Add logging for client creation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Factory Function
1. Create `user_client.go` in railway package:
   ```go
   // GetUserRailwayClient creates a Railway client for a specific user
   // by fetching their Railway token from Vault
   func GetUserRailwayClient(
       ctx context.Context,
       userID string,
       vault vault.SecretStore,
       endpoint string,
       httpc *http.Client,
   ) (*Client, error) {
       if vault == nil {
           return nil, errors.New("vault not configured, cannot get user railway client")
       }
       
       token, err := vault.GetRailwayToken(ctx, userID)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get railway token for user %s: %w", userID, err)
       }
       
       client := NewClient(endpoint, token, httpc)
       log.Debug().Str("user_id", userID).Msg("created user-specific railway client")
       return client, nil
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Add Helper for Controllers
1. Add helper that can fall back to global token:
   ```go
   // GetRailwayClientForUser returns a user-specific Railway client if Vault
   // is enabled, otherwise returns a client with the global Railway token
   func GetRailwayClientForUser(
       ctx context.Context,
       userID string,
       vault vault.SecretStore,
       globalClient *Client,
   ) (*Client, error) {
       if vault != nil {
           return GetUserRailwayClient(ctx, userID, vault, globalClient.endpoint, nil)
       }
       
       // Fall back to global client if Vault not enabled
       log.Debug().Str("user_id", userID).Msg("using global railway client (vault disabled)")
       return globalClient, nil
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Error Types
1. Add specific error for missing token:
   ```go
   var (
       ErrNoRailwayToken = errors.New("no railway token configured for user")
       ErrVaultDisabled  = errors.New("vault is disabled, cannot fetch user token")
   )
   ```

## Test Plan

**Success Criteria**:
- Factory function creates client with user's token from Vault
- Missing token returns clear error
- Fallback to global client when Vault disabled
- Existing code continues to work with NewClient

**Test Steps**:
1. Create user-specific client with valid Vault token
2. Try with user who has no token (should error)
3. Try with Vault disabled (should use global client)
4. Verify existing NewClient still works

## Verification

- [x] `user_client.go` created in railway package
- [x] GetUserRailwayClient function implemented
- [x] GetRailwayClientForUser helper implemented
- [x] Error types defined in `errors.go`
- [x] Logging added (Debug level for client creation)
- [x] Code compiles successfully
- [x] Existing Railway client code unchanged
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## Files Modified

- `api/internal/railway/user_client.go` (new)
- `api/internal/railway/errors.go` (new)

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Factory Pattern**: Implemented two complementary factory functions:
   - `GetUserRailwayClient()`: Direct user-specific client creation with Vault requirement
   - `GetRailwayClientForUser()`: Graceful degradation with fallback to global client

2. **Error Handling**: Created three specific error types in `errors.go`:
   - `ErrNoRailwayToken`: User has no Railway token configured in Vault
   - `ErrVaultDisabled`: Attempting to get user client without Vault
   - `ErrVaultRequired`: Vault client is nil but required

3. **Vault Integration**: Uses the `vault.SecretStore` interface for fetching tokens:
   - Calls `GetRailwayToken(ctx, userID)` from task 17-9
   - Properly handles `vault.ErrSecretNotFound` and converts to `ErrNoRailwayToken`
   - Wraps other Vault errors with context for debugging

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing `NewClient()` function untouched
   - Existing `NewFromConfig()` function untouched
   - All existing Railway package tests pass
   - No changes to `Client` struct or existing methods

5. **Logging Strategy**:
   - Debug level logging for user client creation (frequent operation)
   - Includes user_id in all log messages for traceability
   - Separate log messages for Vault-enabled vs fallback paths

### Usage Pattern for Controllers

Controllers will use the factory functions in task 17-15:

```go
// In controller handler
user, _ := auth.GetCurrentUser(ctx)

// Option 1: Direct user client (fails if no token)
railwayClient, err := railway.GetUserRailwayClient(
    ctx, user.ID, c.VaultClient, "", nil,
)

// Option 2: With fallback (graceful degradation)
railwayClient, err := railway.GetRailwayClientForUser(
    ctx, user.ID, c.VaultClient, c.GlobalRailwayClient,
)
```

### Testing Considerations

The implementation is ready for:
- Unit tests with mocked Vault client
- Integration tests with real Vault instance
- Error scenario testing (no token, Vault unavailable)
- Fallback behavior testing

### Next Steps

Task 17-15 will update controllers to:
1. Add Vault client to controller structs
2. Call `GetRailwayClientForUser()` in handlers
3. Extract user ID from authenticated context
4. Handle `ErrNoRailwayToken` with clear user-facing messages
