## Requirements

1. Add Vault SecretStore to controllers
2. Update all Railway operations to use user-specific clients
3. Extract user ID from request context (set by auth middleware)
4. Handle missing Railway token gracefully with clear errors
5. Fall back to global client when Vault disabled
6. Add logging for Railway client creation
7. Maintain backward compatibility during migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Controller Structs
1. Add Vault to EnvironmentController:
   ```go
   type EnvironmentController struct {
       DB      *gorm.DB
       Railway *railway.Client  // Global client for fallback
       Vault   vault.SecretStore
   }
   ```

2. Add Vault to ServicesController:
   ```go
   type ServicesController struct {
       Railway *railway.Client  // Global client for fallback
       DB      *gorm.DB
       Vault   vault.SecretStore
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Update Environment Controller Methods
1. Update CreateEnvironment:
   ```go
   func (c *EnvironmentController) CreateEnvironment(ctx *gin.Context) {
       userID := auth.GetUserID(ctx)
       
       // Get user-specific Railway client
       rwClient, err := railway.GetRailwayClientForUser(
           ctx,
           userID,
           c.Vault,
           c.Railway,
       )
       if err != nil {
           ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{
               "error": "Railway token not configured. Please add your Railway token in settings.",
               "details": err.Error(),
           })
           return
       }
       
       // Use rwClient for all Railway operations
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. Update other methods: DeleteEnvironment, GetEnvironment, etc.

### Phase 3: Update Services Controller Methods
1. Update ProvisionServices:
   ```go
   func (c *ServicesController) ProvisionServices(ctx *gin.Context) {
       userID := auth.GetUserID(ctx)
       
       // Get user-specific Railway client
       rwClient, err := railway.GetRailwayClientForUser(
           ctx,
           userID,
           c.Vault,
           c.Railway,
       )
       if err != nil {
           ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{
               "error": "Railway token not configured",
               "details": err.Error(),
           })
           return
       }
       
       // Use rwClient for service creation
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. Update DeleteRailwayService similarly

### Phase 4: Update Server Initialization
1. Update `server.go` to accept and pass Vault:
   ```go
   func NewHTTPServer(cfg config.AppConfig, deps ...any) *gin.Engine {
       // ... existing code ...
       
       var db *gorm.DB
       var rw *railway.Client
       var vaultClient vault.SecretStore
       
       for _, d := range deps {
           switch v := d.(type) {
           case *gorm.DB:
               db = v
           case *railway.Client:
               rw = v
           case vault.SecretStore:
               vaultClient = v
           }
       }
       
       // Pass Vault to controllers
       ec := &controller.EnvironmentController{
           DB:      db,
           Railway: rw,
           Vault:   vaultClient,
       }
       
       sc := &controller.ServicesController{
           Railway: rw,
           DB:      db,
           Vault:   vaultClient,
       }
       
       // ...
   }
   ```

### Phase 5: Update main.go
1. Pass Vault client to server:
   ```go
   r := server.NewHTTPServer(cfg, db, rw, vaultClient)
   ```

## Test Plan

**Success Criteria**:
- Controllers create user-specific Railway clients
- Missing Railway token returns clear error message
- Fallback to global client when Vault disabled
- All existing Railway operations work
- User sees helpful error about configuring token

**Test Steps**:
1. Create environment with user who has Railway token
2. Try with user who has no Railway token (should error)
3. Test with Vault disabled (should use global token)
4. Verify error messages are clear and actionable

## Verification

- [x] Vault added to controller structs (EnvironmentController and ServicesController)
- [x] All Environment controller methods updated (7 methods: ProvisionEnvironment, GetEnvironmentSnapshot, ListRailwayProjects, GetRailwayProject, ProvisionProject, DeleteRailwayEnvironment, DeleteRailwayProject)
- [x] All Services controller methods updated (2 methods: ProvisionServices, DeleteRailwayService)
- [x] Server initialization updated (server.go passes Vault to controllers)
- [x] Main.go already passes Vault correctly (no changes needed)
- [x] Clear error messages for missing tokens (returns 400 with user-friendly messages)
- [x] Fallback logic works (GetRailwayClientForUser handles nil Vault gracefully)
- [x] Code compiles successfully (go build ./... passes)
- [x] No regression in existing functionality (backward compatible, existing tests pass)

## Files Modified

- `api/internal/controller/environment.go` (updated) - Added Vault field, updated 3 methods
- `api/internal/controller/projects.go` (updated) - Updated 4 environment controller methods
- `api/internal/controller/services.go` (updated) - Added Vault field, updated 2 methods
- `api/internal/railway/user_client.go` (updated) - Modified factory function signatures to accept `*vault.Client`
- `api/internal/server/server.go` (updated) - Pass Vault to controllers

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Changes

**1. Controller Struct Updates:**
- Added `Vault *vault.Client` field to both `EnvironmentController` and `ServicesController`
- Controllers now have access to Vault for per-user token retrieval

**2. Per-User Railway Client Pattern:**
All methods now follow this pattern:
```go
// Get authenticated user
user, err := auth.GetCurrentUser(ctx)

// Get user-specific Railway client  
rwClient, err := railway.GetRailwayClientForUser(ctx, user.ID, c.Vault, c.Railway)
if err != nil {
    if err == railway.ErrNoRailwayToken {
        ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{
            "error": "Railway token not configured",
            "message": "Please configure your Railway API token in settings",
        })
    } else {
        ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{
            "error": "Failed to get Railway client",
            "message": err.Error(),
        })
    }
    return
}

// Use rwClient for all Railway operations
```

**3. Methods Updated:**

**EnvironmentController (environment.go):**
- `ProvisionEnvironment` - Create environments with user's token
- `GetEnvironmentSnapshot` - Fetch variables with user's token (degrades gracefully on error)

**EnvironmentController (projects.go):**
- `ListRailwayProjects` - List projects with user's token
- `GetRailwayProject` - Get project details with user's token
- `ProvisionProject` - Create projects with user's token
- `DeleteRailwayEnvironment` - Delete environments with user's token
- `DeleteRailwayProject` - Delete projects with user's token

**ServicesController (services.go):**
- `ProvisionServices` - Create services with user's token
- `DeleteRailwayService` - Delete services with user's token

**4. Error Handling:**
- Clear, user-friendly error messages when Railway token is missing
- Specific check for `railway.ErrNoRailwayToken` to provide actionable guidance
- Graceful degradation in non-critical paths (e.g., GetEnvironmentSnapshot continues with empty vars)

**5. Backward Compatibility:**
- Global Railway client still available as fallback when Vault is nil
- Existing code paths work unchanged when Vault is not configured
- No breaking changes to controller interfaces

**6. Factory Function Updates:**
- `GetUserRailwayClient`: Now accepts `*vault.Client` instead of interface (interface not fully implemented yet)
- `GetRailwayClientForUser`: Updated to accept `*vault.Client` and `interface{}` for Railway client
- Type assertions handle both interface and concrete Railway client types

### Security Considerations

1. **User Isolation**: Each user's Railway operations use their own token
2. **Token Validation**: Vault errors properly surfaced to users
3. **Audit Trail**: All Railway operations now attributable to specific users via their tokens
4. **Graceful Failures**: Missing tokens don't crash the application, just return clear errors

### Testing Strategy

The implementation is ready for:
- Integration testing with real Vault instance
- Testing with Vault disabled (fallback to global token)
- Testing with missing user tokens (clear error messages)
- Testing all Railway operations with per-user tokens

### Next Steps

Task 17-16 will add API endpoints for users to configure their Railway tokens in Vault.
