[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the main credentials management page with a tabbed interface for managing all secret types: Railway tokens, GitHub PATs, Docker registries, and custom secrets.

## Status History

| 2025-10-10 00:30:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Starting implementation of credentials settings page | AI Agent |
| 2025-10-10 00:45:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Credentials page with tabbed interface complete, navigation added, responsive layout implemented | AI Agent |
| 2025-10-10 02:00:00 | Status Change | Review | Done | Tested and working - credentials page complete | User |

## Requirements

1. Create new page: `/settings/credentials`
2. Implement tabbed interface with tabs:
   - Railway Token
   - GitHub Token
   - Docker Registries
   - Custom Secrets
3. Add navigation link in settings menu
4. Implement responsive layout
5. Add loading states for each tab
6. Use consistent styling with existing pages

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `/web/src/app/settings/credentials/page.tsx`
2. Create tab component structure using shadcn/ui Tabs
3. Create placeholder content for each tab
4. Add to settings navigation
5. Implement loading skeletons
6. Add proper TypeScript types

## Test Plan

**Success Criteria**:
- Page loads without errors
- All tabs clickable and switch content
- Navigation works from settings
- Responsive on mobile and desktop
- Loading states display correctly

## Verification

- [x] Credentials page created
- [x] Tabbed interface implemented
- [x] All tabs render
- [x] Navigation added
- [x] Responsive layout
- [x] Page compiles successfully

## Files Modified

- `web/src/app/(app)/settings/credentials/page.tsx` (new)
- `web/src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` (updated)

## Implementation Notes

### Page Structure

Created credentials page at `web/src/app/(app)/settings/credentials/page.tsx` with:
- Client-side rendering ("use client" directive)
- Responsive layout with max-w-screen-2xl container
- Consistent spacing (space-y-6) matching dashboard patterns
- Page header with title and description

### Tabbed Interface

Implemented using shadcn/ui Tabs component with 4 tabs:
1. **Railway Token** - Key icon, for Railway API token management
2. **GitHub Token** - GitHub icon, for GitHub PAT management  
3. **Docker Registries** - Package icon, for container registry credentials
4. **Custom Secrets** - FolderLock icon, for user-defined secrets

**Responsive Tab Labels:**
- Desktop: Full text ("Railway Token", "GitHub Token", etc.)
- Mobile: Short text ("Railway", "GitHub", etc.)
- Grid layout on mobile (grid-cols-4), inline-flex on desktop

### Tab Content Structure

Each tab contains:
- Card component with CardHeader and CardContent
- CardTitle with descriptive name
- CardDescription with help text
- Placeholder content area indicating future implementation
- Consistent spacing and styling

### Navigation Integration

Added navigation link to credentials page in `DashboardHeader.tsx`:
- Integrated with Clerk's UserButton component
- Uses UserButton.MenuItems and UserButton.Link
- Custom label with key emoji icon (ðŸ”‘)
- Links to `/settings/credentials`
- Appears in user dropdown menu

### Design Considerations

1. **Icons**: Uses lucide-react icons consistent with the app
2. **Spacing**: Follows existing patterns (gap-2, space-y-4/6)
3. **Cards**: Uses shadcn Card components matching dashboard style
4. **Typography**: text-3xl for title, text-muted-foreground for descriptions
5. **Responsive**: Mobile-first with sm: and lg: breakpoints
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels via shadcn components

### Future Implementation

Each tab currently shows a placeholder message. Subsequent tasks will implement:
- Task 17-22: Railway Token tab with status card, add/update modal, actions
- Task 17-23: GitHub and Docker tabs with CRUD operations
- Task 17-24: Custom Secrets tab with versioning and rollback

### Testing Considerations

The implementation is ready for:
- Manual testing by navigating to `/settings/credentials`
- Tab switching functionality
- Mobile responsive behavior
- Navigation from user dropdown menu
- Visual consistency with existing pages
