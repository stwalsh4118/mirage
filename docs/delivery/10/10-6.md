# [10-6] Error handling, retries, and cleanup UX

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Define consistent error states, retries, and cleanup flows so users can recover from failures during project/environment/service creation.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-09-11 12:24:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | ai-agent |

## Requirements
- Error taxonomy (validation vs transient vs permanent).
- Retry affordances and automatic backoff for transient failures.
- Cleanup options for partially created resources.
- Logging/telemetry hooks for diagnostics.

## Implementation Plan
- Standardize error responses and UI states.
- Implement retry helpers and cleanup endpoints.
- Add telemetry events.

## Test Plan
- Simulated failures across steps; verify user guidance and cleanup.

## Verification
- Users can recover or clean up without manual intervention.

## Files Modified
- Frontend error components; backend error mapping and cleanup handlers.
