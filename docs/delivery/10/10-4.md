# [10-4] Step 3: Review/Confirm

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Add a review screen summarizing all choices before creating resources. Strategy toggle de-scoped from MVP.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-09-11 12:22:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | ai-agent |
| 2025-09-12 12:25:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Implementing Review summary and confirm | ai-agent |
| 2025-09-12 12:40:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Done | Strategy toggle removed; shows project name | ai-agent |

## Requirements
- Strategy toggle: sequential/parallel (MVP may use a single default but allow UI selection).
- Review screen summarizing project choice, environment name, template, TTL, env vars.
- Confirm action triggers submission.

## Implementation Plan
- Implement summary component with edit links to previous steps.
- Strategy control with persisted selection.
- Final validation before enabling Confirm.

## Test Plan
- Summary reflects state accurately.
- Confirm disabled until valid.

## Verification
- Proceed to submission only when state is valid; strategy choice persisted.

## Files Modified
- Wizard step component and summary components.
