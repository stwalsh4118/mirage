## Requirements
- Backend endpoints covering: createProject, createEnvironment, createService(s), configuration updates.
- Idempotent handling with request IDs; resume on partial failures.
- Progress reporting structure consumable by UI.
- Error classification with actionable messages.

## Implementation Plan
- Define API contracts; wire client hooks.
- Orchestrate submission flow with retries/backoff.
- Emit progress events; map to UI statuses.

## Test Plan
- Integration tests for submission success and partial failures.
- Simulate network errors and verify retries.

## Verification
- Successful creation results in visible env and initial services.
- Errors are reported with clear remediation steps.

## Files Modified
- Backend controller/handlers; frontend hooks and submission orchestrator.
