# [20-10] Implement search functionality

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Implement client-side search functionality that allows users to quickly find documentation content across all pages. The search should be fast, accurate, and provide helpful results with context.

## Requirements
- Implement client-side search across all documentation content
- Search should index markdown content including titles, headings, and body text
- Provide search UI component (search bar with results dropdown)
- Show search results with context snippets
- Highlight matching terms in results
- Support keyboard navigation in search results
- Make search accessible via keyboard shortcut (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + K)
- Provide "no results" state with helpful message
- Mobile-friendly search interface

## Implementation Plan
- Choose search library (options: flexsearch, fuse.js, minisearch)
- Create search index build process:
  - Extract searchable content from markdown files
  - Build search index at build time or runtime
  - Include metadata (titles, headings, paths)
- Create `SearchBar` component with:
  - Input field with keyboard shortcut hint
  - Results dropdown with keyboard navigation
  - Result items with context snippets
  - Highlighted matching terms
- Add search modal/overlay for focused search experience
- Implement keyboard shortcut registration
- Index content including:
  - Page titles and descriptions
  - Headings (h1-h3)
  - Body text (with appropriate weighting)
  - Code blocks (optional, with lower priority)
- Add search to documentation header/navigation
- Optimize for performance (debounced input, lazy loading)

## Test Plan
### Objective
Verify search functionality works efficiently and returns relevant results.

### Test Scope
- Search indexing completeness
- Search accuracy and relevance
- UI/UX functionality
- Performance

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Search for common terms and verify results
2. Test partial word matching
3. Verify result context snippets are helpful
4. Test keyboard navigation in results
5. Test keyboard shortcut activation (Cmd/Ctrl + K)
6. Verify "no results" state displays correctly
7. Test search on mobile devices
8. Verify performance with large result sets
9. Test highlighting of matching terms
10. Verify search across all documentation sections

### Success Criteria
- Search indexes all documentation content
- Results are relevant and well-ranked
- Search UI is responsive and intuitive
- Keyboard shortcut works correctly
- Results include helpful context
- Performance is fast (< 100ms for typical queries)
- Works well on mobile devices

## Verification
- Search functionality is accessible from documentation pages
- Search returns relevant results quickly
- Keyboard shortcut activates search
- Results include context and highlights
- Mobile search experience is smooth
