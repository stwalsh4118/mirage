## Requirements
- Add `/docs` route to the application router
- Create `DocsLayout` component that will wrap all documentation pages
- Create main documentation index page (`/docs`)
- Establish consistent page structure (header, main content area, optional sidebar space)
- Ensure routing supports nested paths for different doc sections (e.g., `/docs/getting-started`, `/docs/features/railway`)
- Maintain responsive design consistent with rest of application

## Implementation Plan
- Update router configuration to add `/docs/*` routes
- Create `apps/web/src/pages/docs/` directory structure
- Build `DocsLayout` component with:
  - Header area for breadcrumbs/title
  - Main content container
  - Placeholder for sidebar (will be implemented in 20-3)
- Create index page at `/docs` with welcome content and links to main sections
- Add navigation link to docs in main app navigation
- Use existing layout patterns and components from the app

## Test Plan
### Objective
Verify that documentation routes are accessible and the layout renders correctly.

### Test Scope
- Route navigation
- Layout component rendering
- Basic responsive behavior

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Navigate to `/docs` and verify page loads
2. Verify layout component renders with expected structure
3. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Verify navigation link in main app works
5. Test nested route structure (prepare for future pages)

### Success Criteria
- `/docs` route is accessible without errors
- Layout component renders with proper structure
- Documentation section is accessible from main navigation
- Layout is responsive and matches app design system

## Verification
- Can navigate to `/docs` route successfully
- Documentation layout renders with expected structure
- Main app navigation includes link to documentation
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Files Modified
- New: `web/src/app/docs/layout.tsx` - Documentation layout with header and sidebar placeholder
- New: `web/src/app/docs/page.tsx` - Documentation home page with section cards
- Updated: `web/src/middleware.ts` - Added `/docs(.*)` to public routes
- Updated: `web/src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` - Added "Docs" link button

## Implementation Notes
- Created documentation layout with custom header matching app style (glass/grain effects)
- Layout includes placeholder sidebar space for future navigation (task 20-3)
- Documentation home page features four main section cards: Getting Started, Features, How-To Guides, and Troubleshooting
- Used shadcn Card components with hover effects and proper spacing
- Added lucide-react icons for visual appeal
- Made docs routes public in Clerk middleware for easy access
- Reused existing styling patterns (sandstorm-bg, glass, grain)
- Build completed successfully with /docs route at 6.98 kB
