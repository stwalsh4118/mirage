# [20-1] Set up docs routing and page structure

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Create the foundational routing and page structure for the documentation section. This includes adding a `/docs` route, creating a documentation layout component, and establishing the basic page structure that will house the documentation content.

## Requirements
- Add `/docs` route to the application router
- Create `DocsLayout` component that will wrap all documentation pages
- Create main documentation index page (`/docs`)
- Establish consistent page structure (header, main content area, optional sidebar space)
- Ensure routing supports nested paths for different doc sections (e.g., `/docs/getting-started`, `/docs/features/railway`)
- Maintain responsive design consistent with rest of application

## Implementation Plan
- Update router configuration to add `/docs/*` routes
- Create `apps/web/src/pages/docs/` directory structure
- Build `DocsLayout` component with:
  - Header area for breadcrumbs/title
  - Main content container
  - Placeholder for sidebar (will be implemented in 20-3)
- Create index page at `/docs` with welcome content and links to main sections
- Add navigation link to docs in main app navigation
- Use existing layout patterns and components from the app

## Test Plan
### Objective
Verify that documentation routes are accessible and the layout renders correctly.

### Test Scope
- Route navigation
- Layout component rendering
- Basic responsive behavior

### Key Test Scenarios
1. Navigate to `/docs` and verify page loads
2. Verify layout component renders with expected structure
3. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Verify navigation link in main app works
5. Test nested route structure (prepare for future pages)

### Success Criteria
- `/docs` route is accessible without errors
- Layout component renders with proper structure
- Documentation section is accessible from main navigation
- Layout is responsive and matches app design system

## Verification
- Can navigate to `/docs` route successfully
- Documentation layout renders with expected structure
- Main app navigation includes link to documentation
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Files Modified
- Router configuration file
- New: `apps/web/src/pages/docs/layout.tsx`
- New: `apps/web/src/pages/docs/index.tsx`
- Main navigation component
