# PBI-20: Integrated Documentation Section

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-20)

## Overview
Build a comprehensive documentation section integrated directly into the Mirage frontend, providing feature guides, how-to content, and troubleshooting resources. The documentation will use markdown-based content rendered in React, reusing existing UI components and styling for a consistent user experience.

## Problem Statement
Users need clear, accessible documentation to understand Mirage's features, learn how to accomplish tasks, and troubleshoot issues. Rather than maintaining a separate documentation site, integrating docs into the application provides a seamless experience and ensures consistency with the application's design system.

## User Stories
- As a new user, I want a getting started guide so I can quickly understand how to set up and use Mirage.
- As a user, I want feature documentation so I can understand what Mirage can do and how different features work.
- As a user, I want how-to guides so I can learn how to accomplish specific tasks.
- As a user, I want troubleshooting documentation so I can resolve common issues independently.
- As a user, I want to navigate and search documentation easily so I can find information quickly.

## Technical Approach
- Frontend: Add `/docs` route with dedicated documentation layout and navigation
- Markdown rendering: Use `react-markdown` or similar library with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Content structure: Organize markdown files by category (getting-started, features, how-to, troubleshooting)
- Navigation: Build sidebar navigation component with section/page hierarchy and breadcrumbs
- Search: Implement client-side search functionality for documentation content
- Styling: Reuse existing Tailwind/shadcn components and theme for consistent look and feel

## UX/UI Considerations
- Documentation should feel like part of the main application, not a separate site
- Sidebar navigation with collapsible sections for easy browsing
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet viewing
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting and copy button
- In-page table of contents for long documents
- Search bar prominently placed for quick access
- Links to related features/pages within the app

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation section accessible via `/docs` route
- Markdown content renders correctly with proper styling
- Navigation sidebar shows all doc sections and pages
- Getting started guide covers prerequisites, setup, and first environment
- Feature documentation covers key capabilities (Railway integration, environments, services, wizard)
- How-to guides provide step-by-step instructions for common workflows
- Troubleshooting section addresses common issues and errors
- Search functionality works across all documentation content
- Documentation reuses existing UI components and matches app styling
- All code examples have syntax highlighting

## Dependencies
- React Router for docs routing
- Markdown rendering library (react-markdown)
- Syntax highlighting library (e.g., prism, highlight.js)
- Existing UI component library (shadcn)

## Open Questions
- Should we include a feedback mechanism for docs (helpful/not helpful)?
- Do we need versioning for documentation as features evolve?
- Should we generate a sitemap for the documentation?
