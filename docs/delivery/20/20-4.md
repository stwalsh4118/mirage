- Installation/setup instructions
- Connecting Railway account to Mirage
- Creating first environment walkthrough
- Overview of key concepts (projects, environments, services, templates)

## Implementation Notes

### Content Structure
All five getting started pages follow a consistent pattern:
- Each page is a Next.js page component using the MarkdownRenderer
- Content written in markdown format with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Navigation buttons at the bottom (Previous/Next) for linear progression
- Wrapped in glass/grain styled containers matching Mirage theme
- All pages successfully compile and build (verified with `pnpm build`)

### Styling & Theme Consistency
All pages use:
- `glass grain` utility classes for card backgrounds
- `border border-border` for consistent borders
- Mirage color scheme (primary, accent, muted-foreground)
- ArrowLeft/ArrowRight icons from lucide-react for navigation
- Consistent spacing with `space-y-6` and `space-y-8`
- Responsive padding (`p-8`, `p-4`)

### Navigation Integration
- Pages integrate with existing DocsSidebar navigation (defined in docsNavigation.ts)
- Breadcrumbs automatically generated by Breadcrumbs component
- Linear navigation flow: Introduction → Prerequisites → Setup → First Environment → Key Concepts
- Each page links to previous/next in sequence
- Final page links to features documentation

### Build Verification
- Ran `pnpm build` successfully
- All 5 pages compiled without errors
- Page sizes: 374 kB First Load JS (consistent with other docs pages)
- No TypeScript or linting errors in new files
- Static generation successful for all pages

### Documentation Rewrite (Post-Audit)

After user review, a comprehensive audit revealed significant discrepancies between documented features and actual implementation:

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Template System**: Documented an entire multi-template system (Dev/Staging/Prod templates with configurations) that does not exist in codebase
2. **Wizard Steps**: Documented wizard steps were incorrect - included fabricated "Template Selection" step
3. **Settings Pages**: Documented profile/preferences pages that don't exist yet
4. **Feature Claims**: Made claims about version control, validation, and other features not yet implemented

**Audit Document Created**: `docs/delivery/20/20-4-audit-findings.md`

**Pages Rewritten:**

1. **Introduction (`introduction/page.tsx`)**: 
   - Removed all template system references
   - Simplified feature claims to match reality
   - Updated wizard description to actual 5-step process
   - Focused on verified features: dashboard, wizard, clone, monorepo support

2. **First Environment (`first-environment/page.tsx`)**: 
   - **Complete rewrite** of wizard walkthrough
   - Corrected to actual 5 steps: Project → Source → Discovery → Config → Review
   - Added clone mode documentation
   - Documented GitHub repo vs Docker image source selection
   - Documented actual monorepo service discovery feature
   - Added per-service environment variables
   - Removed all template selection content

3. **Key Concepts (`key-concepts/page.tsx`)**:
   - Removed detailed template system descriptions
   - Simplified to environment types (labels only: dev/staging/prod/ephemeral)
   - Added clone functionality documentation
   - Kept verified Railway concepts

4. **Setup (`setup/page.tsx`)**:
   - Removed non-existent profile settings section
   - Removed non-existent preferences configuration
   - Simplified to focus on workspace token connection
   - Updated dashboard navigation to match reality

5. **Prerequisites (`prerequisites/page.tsx`)**:
   - ✅ Already accurate (workspace token focus maintained)

**Verification:**
- All pages rebuilt successfully
- No TypeScript or build errors
- Content now accurately reflects codebase implementation
- Removed ~2000+ words of fabricated content
- Rewrote ~2500+ words to match actual features

### Content Refactoring (Markdown Files)

Refactored documentation to use separate markdown files instead of inline strings:

**Structure Created:**
- Created `/web/src/content/docs/getting-started/` directory
- Moved all markdown content from inline strings to `.md` files:
  - `introduction.md` (4.8K)
  - `prerequisites.md` (6.6K)
  - `setup.md` (7.1K)
  - `first-environment.md` (16K)
  - `key-concepts.md` (12K)

**Benefits:**
- Better separation of concerns (content vs. presentation)
- Easier to edit documentation without touching React code
- Better for version control (cleaner diffs)
- More maintainable long-term
- Consistent with documentation best practices

**Implementation:**
- Created utility function `getDocsContent()` in `/web/src/lib/docs.ts`
- Abstracted file reading logic to avoid duplication across pages
- Updated all page.tsx files to async functions using the utility
- Use Node.js `fs.promises` to read markdown files at build time
- Files are read once during static generation (no runtime overhead)
- All pages remain statically generated (○ symbol in build output)
- Clean, DRY code: each page.tsx is now ~25 lines instead of ~35

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build successful with new structure
- ✅ All pages generate statically
- ✅ No performance impact (same bundle sizes)
- ✅ Content successfully separated from components
