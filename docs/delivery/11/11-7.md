# [11-7] Update service cards to display deployment type

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Enhance service cards and detail views throughout the UI to display whether a service is deployed from source code or from a Docker image, including relevant metadata like image reference.

## Requirements
- Add deployment type badge to service cards
  - "Source" badge with git icon for repo-based services
  - "Image" badge with container icon for image-based services
- Display appropriate metadata based on deployment type:
  - Source-based: show repo URL and branch
  - Image-based: show image reference (registry/image:tag)
- Update service detail view to show full deployment configuration
- Add visual distinction (different colors/icons) for deployment types
- Ensure consistent display across all service views:
  - Environment detail page (service list)
  - Dashboard (if services are shown)
  - Service detail pages
- Show image registry icon (Docker logo, GitHub logo) where appropriate

## Implementation Plan
1. Update service card component to read deployment type
2. Add badge component for deployment type display
3. Conditionally render repo info vs image info
4. Add icons for source (GitBranch) and image (Package/Container)
5. Update service detail view with deployment configuration section
6. Add registry-specific icons (Docker, GitHub)
7. Style badges with appropriate colors
8. Test with both deployment types
9. Ensure backward compatibility with existing services

## Test Plan
### Basic Implementation Scope
- Service cards display correct badge for deployment type
- Source-based services show repo and branch
- Image-based services show image reference
- Icons display correctly for each type
- Service detail view shows full deployment configuration
- Visual design is clear and professional
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing services

## Verification
- Deployment type badges appear on all service cards
- Correct metadata displayed based on deployment type
- Icons are clear and visually distinct
- Design is consistent across all views
- No layout issues or visual regressions
- Existing services still display correctly

## Files Modified
- `web/src/components/service/ServiceCard.tsx` (or equivalent)
- `web/src/components/service/ServiceDetail.tsx` (or equivalent)
- `web/src/components/environment/EnvironmentDetail.tsx` (service list display)
- `web/src/components/common/DeploymentTypeBadge.tsx` (new component)
