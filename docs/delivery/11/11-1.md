# [11-1] Research Railway API for Docker image deployments

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Research and document Railway's GraphQL API capabilities for creating services from Docker images, including supported registries, authentication methods, and mutation signatures. Create a technical guide documenting the API usage patterns for image-based deployments.

## Requirements
- Document Railway's GraphQL mutations for image-based service creation
- Identify supported container registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, custom registries)
- Document authentication mechanisms for private registries
- Document image reference format requirements (registry/image:tag vs digest)
- Document any limitations or constraints (image size, architecture support)
- Create `11-1-railway-docker-guide.md` with API examples and patterns
- Test API calls against Railway's staging/production environment

## Implementation Plan
1. Use Railway's GraphQL introspection to discover relevant mutations
2. Search Railway documentation for image deployment examples
3. Test `serviceCreate` mutation with image source instead of repo source
4. Document mutation signatures and required/optional fields
5. Test with Docker Hub public image (e.g., `nginx:latest`)
6. Test with GHCR public image (e.g., `ghcr.io/owner/image:tag`)
7. Document authentication workflow for private registries
8. Identify any Railway-specific configuration for image deployments
9. Create comprehensive guide document with code examples

## Test Plan
- GraphQL introspection successfully reveals image deployment mutations
- Test mutation creates service from Docker Hub public image
- Test mutation creates service from GHCR public image
- Document any errors or limitations encountered
- Guide document includes working code examples

## Verification
- `11-1-railway-docker-guide.md` exists and is comprehensive
- Guide includes mutation signatures with all parameters
- Guide includes working examples for Docker Hub and GHCR
- Authentication mechanisms are documented
- Limitations and constraints are clearly stated

## Files Modified
- `docs/delivery/11/11-1-railway-docker-guide.md` (created)
